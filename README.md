Stupid batch program that simulates key presses

This batch file is a simple script that can be run on any windows machine. When run it will simply ask you for a:

'Wait period' - how long you want to wait between each word is pasted, approximately in seconds.
'Word' - the word that you want to spam.

To get the desired effect, run the bat file, enter the details and then place your cursor where you wish the spamming to begin. Wait approximately 5 seconds and enjoy.

The applications of this programme are perhaps ambigous, and I would prefer it to remain that way. Use this as you wish, but I will not take any responsibility for any troubles you have caused, whether that be annoyed friends or broken websites.

This is far from perfect, just a nice little script I wrote whilst bored, any suggestions or improvements are welcome. Enjoy.
